Turns Anaplan “Referenced By” text into a clean and readable table of module and line item references. Helps with impact analysis and debugging. No login, no backend, runs in the browser.

🔍 Anaplan Reference Viewer

When working in Anaplan, the "Referenced By" column can quickly become overwhelming — especially when a line item is referenced across many modules. The native UI often compresses references into a long, comma-separated text block that is difficult to read, navigate, or analyze. As a result, it's easy to miss key dependencies during model audit, debugging, or structural planning.

This tool solves that.

Simply paste the raw Referenced By text into the viewer, and it automatically formats it into a clean, readable table showing:

| # | Module Name | Line Item Name |

This makes it much easier to:

Understand model dependencies

Trace line item relationships

Perform impact analysis

Debug calculation flows

Clean up unused or duplicate line items

No login, no backend, no dependencies — just a simple, lightweight HTML/JS tool that runs directly in your browser.
